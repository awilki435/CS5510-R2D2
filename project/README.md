# Running the Final Project

from the prject folder can act like your ROS2 workspace folder

Build the `ball_moving_robot` package. 

Place the balls 130 cm away from the robot, and the goal 200 cm away from the robot

Run `ros2 launch ball_moving_robot launch_robot.launch.py`

Common issues:

Sometimes the image doesnt capture so you have to restart the code and try it again.
The robot motors sometimes move at diffrent speeds

Packages include
numpy
